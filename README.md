## 🚩 **Problem Statement**
Water bodies in Delhi, including the Yamuna and local lakes, are plagued by severe pollution due to waste dumping and neglect. This contamination not only degrades the environment but poses health risks to nearby residents and disrupts the ecosystem.

---

## 🌟 **Solution Overview**
**Swachh Neer** is a web platform designed to monitor the real-time status of water bodies in Delhi. By integrating live data from CPCB government sources, it tracks critical water quality parameters like temperature, pH levels, dissolved oxygen, sulfates, and nitrates. Through visually appealing infographics, such as bar graphs, line charts, and pie charts, users can easily interpret the health of these water bodies. The platform also employs an ML model to predict water quality trends and offers actionable insights to rejuvenate the water bodies and prevent further degradation.
